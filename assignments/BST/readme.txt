Write a C++ menu driven program that uses a Binary Search Tree (BST)
to store the input data.

The program will read in data from an input file, and store each word
in the tree, as well as keep a count of how many times each word appears
in the input file.  Thus, each node in the tree will have the following
data:  a string to store the word and an integer to keep track of the count.

An output will be a list of unique words that appear in the input file,
along with a count of how many times they appeared.
